## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Subscription Service Enhancements

#### New Features
- **Mixed Cart Support**: Enhanced subscription handling for carts containing both subscription items and one-time items
- **One-Time Item Invoicing**: Automatic creation of separate invoices for one-time items in mixed carts
- **Recurring Shipping Fee Support**: Automatic creation and management of shipping prices
- **Shipping Price Integration**: Seamless integration of shipping fees into subscriptions
- **Enhanced Metadata Tracking**: Improved tracking of shipping method information
- **Quantity Support**: Enhanced quantity handling for subscription items with proper validation

#### New Methods
- `getAllLineItemPrices()`: Retrieves all line item prices excluding subscription items
- `createOneTimeItemsInvoice()`: Creates separate Stripe invoices for one-time items
- `getSubscriptionShippingPriceId()`: Retrieves or creates shipping price IDs
- `getStripeShippingPriceByMetadata()`: Searches for existing shipping prices
- `createStripeShippingPrice()`: Creates new Stripe shipping prices

#### Technical Improvements
- Updated method signatures for better type safety
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- New TypeScript interfaces and constants
- Improved metadata management

#### Mixed Cart Support Implementation

The subscription service now supports mixed carts containing both subscription items and one-time items. This feature enables customers to purchase subscription products alongside regular products in a single transaction.

##### Key Features
- **Automatic Item Classification**: System automatically identifies subscription vs. one-time items
- **Separate Processing**: Subscription items processed as recurring billing, one-time items as immediate invoices
- **Unified Checkout Experience**: Single checkout process for mixed cart scenarios
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error handling for edge cases

##### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Mixed cart processing in createSubscription()
const oneTimeItems = await this.getAllLineItemPrices(cart);
if (oneTimeItems.length > 0) {
  await this.createOneTimeItemsInvoice(cart, stripeCustomerId!, oneTimeItems);
}

// Create subscription with only subscription and shipping items
const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
  ...subscriptionParams,
  customer: stripeCustomerId!,
  items: [
    { price: priceId, quantity: this.findSubscriptionLineItem(cart).quantity || 1 }, 
    ...(shippingPriceId ? [{ price: shippingPriceId }] : []),
  ],
  // ... other parameters
});
```

##### Benefits
- **Flexible Cart Configurations**: Customers can mix subscription and one-time items freely
- **Seamless Checkout**: Single checkout process for mixed cart scenarios
- **Proper Billing**: Correct billing treatment for different item types
- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: No need for separate transactions

### 2. Enabler Improvements

#### Payment Mode Handling
- Conditional element updates based on payment mode
- Prevention of unnecessary operations in setup mode
- Enhanced error handling for different payment flows

#### Debugging Enhancements
- Comprehensive logging for subscription creation
- Enhanced error tracking for payment confirmation
- Better debugging information for troubleshooting

#### Code Examples
```typescript
// Conditional element updates
if(this.baseOptions.paymentMode !== 'setup') {
  this.baseOptions.elements.update({amount: response});
}

// Enhanced payment confirmation
const confirmedPayment = await this.stripe.confirmStripePayment({
  // ... parameters
});
const paymentIntentId = confirmedPayment.id;
```

### 3. Payment Service Enhancements

#### Shipping Address Integration
- Re-enabled shipping address integration with conditional logic
- Conditional inclusion based on billing address collection settings
- Improved validation and error handling

#### Payment Method Options
- Support for multicapture and advanced card configurations
- Enhanced payment method options for better processing
- Improved security through better configuration

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Conditional shipping address inclusion
...(config.stripeCollectBillingAddress === 'auto' && {
  shipping: shippingAddress,
}),

// Enhanced payment method options
payment_method_options: {
  card: {
    request_multicapture: 'if_available',
  },
},
```

### 4. Testing Improvements

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage

### 5. Attribute Name Standardization

#### Overview
The connector has been updated to use a standardized naming convention for all subscription-related product type attributes. All attributes now use the `stripeConnector_` prefix for better organization, consistency, and maintainability.

#### Key Changes
- **Attribute Name Updates**: All 15 subscription-related attributes now use the `stripeConnector_` prefix
- **Automatic Transformation**: Enhanced `transformVariantAttributes` function to automatically strip prefixes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Support for both old and new attribute name formats
- **Improved Organization**: Clear separation between connector-specific and general product attributes

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Enhanced attribute transformation
export const transformVariantAttributes = <T>(attributes?: Attribute[]): T => {
  const result: Record<string, string> = {};
  for (const { name, value } of attributes ?? []) {
    // Remove 'stripeConnector_' prefix if present
    const cleanName = name.startsWith('stripeConnector_') ? name.replace('stripeConnector_', '') : name;
    result[cleanName] = isObject(value) ? value.key : value;
  }
  return result as T;
};
```

#### Benefits
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation between connector-specific attributes and general product attributes
- **Improved Maintainability**: Reduced naming conflicts and clear attribute ownership
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Backward compatibility maintained through automatic transformation
- **Better Debugging**: Clear attribute ownership in logs and error messages

- `processor/src/services/commerce-tools/product-type-client.ts`: Added `updateProductType` function
- `processor/test/utils/utils.spec.ts`: Added tests for attribute name transformation

#### Migration Impact
- **No Breaking Changes**: All changes are backward compatible
- **Automatic Handling**: System automatically handles both attribute name formats
- **No Migration Required**: Existing implementations continue to work without changes
- **Future-Proof**: New deployments use standardized naming convention
- Tests for all subscription service methods
