# Recent Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the recent architectural improvements and enhancements made to the Stripe-Commercetools payment connector, focusing on the enhanced subscription service architecture and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Refactored Price Synchronization Configuration (Breaking Change)

The connector has been refactored to separate price synchronization from payment handling strategy, providing clearer configuration options and better separation of concerns.

#### Breaking Change Details
- **Removed**: `upcomingInvoice` option from `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PAYMENT_HANDLING`
- **Added**: New `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_SYNC_ENABLED` environment variable
- **Rationale**: Price synchronization is independent of payment handling and should be controlled separately

#### New Configuration Structure
- **Payment Handling**: `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PAYMENT_HANDLING` (createOrder|addPaymentToOrder)
- **Price Synchronization**: `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_SYNC_ENABLED` (true|false)
  - `true`: Price updates happen **before** invoice creation (current billing cycle)
  - `false`: Price updates happen **after** payment via `createOrder` method (next billing cycle)

#### Price Synchronization Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically synchronizes subscription prices with current commercetools product prices before invoice creation
- **Same-Period Billing**: Price changes take effect for the current billing period (not the next one)
- **Automatic Detection**: System detects price differences and updates subscriptions without manual intervention
- **Webhook-Driven**: Triggered by `invoice.upcoming` webhook events for optimal timing
- **No Proration**: Uses `proration_behavior: 'none'` to avoid additional charges
- **Billing Cycle Preservation**: Maintains existing billing cycle with `billing_cycle_anchor: 'unchanged'`

#### Configuration Benefits
- **Clearer Separation**: Payment handling vs price synchronization are now separate concerns
- **More Flexible**: Can enable price sync with any payment handling strategy
- **Better Naming**: `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_SYNC_ENABLED` clearly indicates its purpose
- **Easier Migration**: Simple boolean flag instead of confusing option name

#### Technical Implementation
The price synchronization process follows this workflow:
1. **Webhook Trigger**: `invoice.upcoming` event received from Stripe
2. **Subscription Retrieval**: Get subscription details from Stripe
3. **Price Comparison**: Compare current Stripe price with commercetools product price
4. **Price Update**: If different, create new Stripe price and update subscription
5. **Invoice Processing**: Continue with normal invoice processing

#### Key Methods
- `processUpcomingSubscriptionEvent()`: Main handler for upcoming invoice events
- `synchronizeSubscriptionPrice()`: Compares and synchronizes prices
- `getOrCreateStripePriceForProduct()`: Creates new Stripe prices when needed
- `updateSubscriptionPrice()`: Updates subscription with new price

### 3. Enhanced Subscription Update API

The connector now provides a comprehensive `updateSubscription` method that enables merchants to update subscriptions with new product variants, prices, and configuration while maintaining data consistency between systems.

#### New updateSubscription Method
- **File**: `processor/src/services/stripe-subscription.service.ts`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive subscription management with product variant and price updates
- **Key Features**:
  - Product variant switching (master variant and specific variants)
  - Price updates with automatic Stripe price creation
  - Subscription configuration inheritance from product attributes
  - Comprehensive validation and error handling

#### Use Cases
1. **Product Variant Changes**: Switch between different product variants (sizes, colors, configurations)
2. **Price Updates**: Update to new pricing tiers or promotional pricing
3. **Subscription Configuration Changes**: Modify billing cycles, trial periods, or other attributes
4. **Product Migration**: Move customers to new product versions or discontinued replacements

#### API Endpoint
- **Route**: `POST /subscription-api/:customerId`
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with "manage_project" and "manage_subscriptions" scopes
- **Request Schema**: Includes subscription ID, new variant ID, variant position, and price ID

#### Technical Implementation
The method follows this workflow:
1. **Validation**: Verifies customer ownership and subscription existence
2. **Product Retrieval**: Fetches new product variant and price from commercetools
3. **Price Creation**: Creates or retrieves corresponding Stripe price
4. **Subscription Update**: Updates Stripe subscription with new configuration
5. **Attribute Synchronization**: Applies subscription attributes from new variant

#### Integration Benefits
- **Seamless Price Sync**: Works with automatic price synchronization system
- **Data Consistency**: Maintains consistency between manual updates and automatic sync
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for missing products, variants, or prices
- **Performance**: Optimized for minimal API calls and maximum reliability

### 2. Enhanced Subscription Service Architecture

The subscription service has undergone major architectural improvements with better separation of concerns and enhanced maintainability.

#### New Price Client Service
- **File**: `processor/src/services/commerce-tools/price-client.ts`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated service for product price management and retrieval
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getProductById(productId)`: Retrieves products with expanded price information
  - `getProductMasterPrice(productId)`: Gets current price from product master variant
- **Features**: Enhanced error handling, comprehensive logging, expanded price data support

### 2. Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure Restructuring

The subscription service testing has been completely restructured for better maintainability and comprehensive coverage.

#### Modular Test Architecture

**Previous Structure**: Single large test file (`stripe-subscription.service.spec.ts`)

**New Structure**: Focused, maintainable test modules:

1. **`stripe-subscription.service.business-logic.spec.ts`**
