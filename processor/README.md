# Payment Integration Processor
This module provides an application based on [commercetools Connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect), which is triggered by HTTP requests from Checkout UI for payment operations.

The corresponding payment, cart or order details would be fetched from composable commerce platform, and then be sent to Stripe for various payment operations such as create/capture/cancel/refund payment.

The module also provides template scripts for post-deployment and pre-undeployment action. After deployment or before undeployment via connect service completed, customized actions can be performed based on users' needs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Please run following npm commands under `processor` folder.

#### Install PSP Stripe SDK
In case SDK is provided by payment service provider for communication purpose, you can import the SDK by following commands
```
$ npm install stripe
```
#### Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
#### Build the application in local environment. NodeJS source codes are then generated under dist folder
```
$ npm run build
```
#### Run automation test
```
$ npm run test
```
#### Run the application in local environment. Remind that the application has been built before it runs
```
$ npm run start
```
#### Fix the code style
```
$ npm run lint:fix
```
#### Verify the code style
```
$ npm run lint
```
#### ==Run post-deploy script in local environment==
```
$ npm run connector:post-deploy
```
#### Run pre-undeploy script in local environment
```
$ npm run connector:pre-undeploy
```

## Running application

Setup correct environment variables: check `processor/src/config/config.ts` for default values.

Make sure commercetools client credential have at least the following permissions:

* `manage_payments`
* `manage_checkout_payment_intents`
* `view_sessions`
* `introspect_oauth_tokens`
* 'view_api_clients'
* 'manage_orders'
* 'manage_types'

```
npm run dev
```

## Authentication

Some of the services have authentication mechanism.

* `oauth2`: Relies on commercetools OAuth2 server
* `session`: Relies on commercetools session service
* `jwt`: Relies on the jwt token injected by the merchant center via the forward-to proxy

### OAuth2
OAuth2 token can be obtained from commercetools OAuth2 server. It requires API Client created beforehand. For details, please refer to [Requesting an access token using the Composable Commerce OAuth 2.0 service](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/authorization#requesting-an-access-token-using-the-composable-commerce-oauth-20-service).

### Session
Payment connectors relies on session to be able to share information between `enabler` and `processor`.
To create session before sharing information between these two modules, please execute following request to commercetools session service
```
POST https://session.<region>.commercetools.com/<commercetools-project-key>/sessions
Authorization: Bearer <oauth token with manage_sessions scope>

{
  "cart": {
    "cartRef": {
      "id": "<cart-id>" 
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "allowedPaymentMethods": ["card", "ideal", ...],
    "paymentInterface"?: "<payment interface that will be set on payment method info https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/payments#ctp:api:type:PaymentMethodInfo>"
  }
}
```

Afterwards, session ID can be obtained from response, which is necessary to be put as `x-session-id` inside request header when sending request to endpoints such as `/operations/config` and `/operations/payments`.

### JSON web token (JWT)

`jwt` needs some workaround to be able to test locally as it depends on the merchant center forward-to proxy.

In order to make easy running the application locally, following commands help to build up a jwt mock server:

####Set environment variable to point to the jwksUrl
```
export CTP_JWKS_URL="http://localhost:9000/jwt/.well-known/jwks.json"
```
####Run the jwt server
```
docker compose up -d
```

####Obtain JWT
```
# Request token
curl --location 'http://localhost:9000/jwt/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "iss": "https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
    "sub": "subject",
    "https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com/claims/project_key": "<commercetools-project-key>"
}'
```
Token can be found in response
```
{"token":"<token>"}
```

Use the token to authenticate requests protected by JWT: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## APIs
The processor exposes the following endpoints to execute various operations with the Stripe platform:

### Collect Payment and Appearance Details
This endpoint retrieves the payment information from the cart in session to use the prebuilt Stripe Payment Element UI component. This component simplifies the payment process for a variety of payment methods. The `paymentComponent` is requested in the query parameters to send the correct appearance from the environment variables configuration.

#### Endpoint
`GET /config-element/:paymentComponent`

#### Query Parameters
-**paymentComponent**: Used to retrieve the correct appearance of the selected payment method. The appearance can be modified in the environment variables `STRIPE_APPEARANCE_PAYMENT_ELEMENT` and should be in the form of a JSON string with escaped double quotes (e.g. "{\"theme\":\"stripe\",\"variables\":{\"colorPrimary\":\"#0570DE\",\"colorBackground\":\"#FFFFFF\",\"colorText\":\"#30313D\",\"colorDanger\":\"#DF1B41\",\"fontFamily\":\"Ideal Sans,system-ui,sansserif\",\"spacingUnit\":\"2px\",\"borderRadius\":\"4px\"}}"). The correct values will be retrieved by the exposed call ´operations/payment-components´, e.g., 'payment'.

#### Response Parameters
The response will provide the necessary information to populate the payment element:
- **cartInfo**: An object containing two attributes:
    - `amount`: Amount in cents for the cart in session.
    - `currency`: Currency selected for the cart in session.
- **appearance**: Optional. Used to customize or theme the payment element rendered by Stripe's prebuilt UI component. It must be a valid [Element Appearance](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api).
- **captureMethod**: The current capture method configured in the payment connector.

### Create Payment Intent from Stripe
This endpoint creates a new [payment intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) in Stripe. It is called after the user fills out all the payment information and submits the payment. 
#### Endpoint
`POST /payments`

#### Query Parameters
N/A

#### Response Parameters
- **sClientSecret**: The client secret is used to complete the payment from your frontend. 
- **paymentReference**: The payment reference of the current process.

### Confirm the Payment Intent to commercetools
This endpoint update the initial payment transaction in commercetools. It is called after the Stripe confirm the payment submit was successful.

#### Endpoint
`POST /confirmPayments/:id`

#### Query Parameters
- **id**: The payment reference of the current process.

#### Response Parameters
- **outcome:"approved|rejected"**: The response of the updated confirmation in commercetools payment transaction.

### Webhook Listener
The webhook listener receives events from your Stripe account as they occur, allowing your integration to automatically execute actions accordingly. By registering webhook endpoints in your Stripe account, you enable Stripe to send [Event objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events) as part of POST requests to the registered webhook endpoint hosted by your application. 
The available webhooks are configured on the `post-deploy.ts` file, and more webhook event can be added in the method `updateWebhookEndpoint`.
The conversion of the webhook event to a transaction is converted in hte `/src/services/converters/stripeEventConverter.ts` file.

The following webhooks currently supported and transformed to different payment transactions in commercetools are:
- **payment_intent.canceled**: Modified the payment transaction Authorization to Failure and create a payment transaction CancelAuthorization: Success 
- **payment_intent.succeeded**: Creates a payment transaction Charge: Success. 
- **payment_intent.requires_action**: Modify the payment transaction Authorization to Pending.
- **payment_intent.payment_failed**: Modify the payment transaction Authorization to Failure.
- **charge.refunded**: Create a payment transaction Refund to Success, and a Chargeback to Success.
- **charge.succeeded**: Logs the information in the connector app inside the Processor logs.
- **charge.captured**: Logs the information in the connector app inside the Processor logs.

#### Endpoint
`POST /stripe/webhooks`

#### Request Parameters
The [Event object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events) sent to your webhook endpoint provides a snapshot of the object that changed. These objects might include a `previous_attributes` property indicating the change, when applicable. This event is received as a raw string because Stripe requires the raw body of the request for signature verification.

#### Response Parameters
The endpoint returns a 200 response to indicate the successful processing of the webhook event.

### Get supported payment components
